The class will review a series of breakthrough innovations and look at the R&D teams that assembled them, discussing the organizational rule sets that appear to be common to these great innovation groups. The focus groups include Edison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvention Factory\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Oppenheimer and Los Alamos, Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley at Bell Labs, Boyer and Swanson founding Genentech,Venter and the genome project, and Robert Taylor at Xerox Parc.\u00c2",

The roles of the individual visionaries (such as JCR Licklider), of government supported R&D (through DARPA), of DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s University researchers, (including at MIT and Stamford), and of DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industry-based research contractors (including at BB&D and Xerox Parc), will be examined in succession.

So when you watch these videos, please keep in mind that I am human, and I make mistakes. For example, at minute 12 of the video of Lec #2 I make a mistake when I describe why the earth is an approximate inertial frame. What I mean to say is that the Earth, though moving, is accelerating relatively slowly with respect to some imaginary but real inertial frame when compared with, say a space-craft. So we treat it as an inertial frame, and experiments show that that is a good approximation. That\u2019s not how I say it in the video, but the students did understand what I meant because the staff of the class interact with the students in a number of ways. So watch these videos but stay alert \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and keep in mind that besides making mistakes, I also sometimes joke with my students.",
